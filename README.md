## Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using **HTML** and **basic CSS**.  
The website consists of two pages: **Home** and **Contact**.

- The **Home** page introduces me and highlights my skills and work.
- The **Contact** page allows visitors to reach out to me.

This project was created to practice front-end development fundamentals and to build a simple, clean portfolio website.
Thank you for visitig mu portfolio website!
